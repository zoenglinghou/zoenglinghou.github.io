# Robotics Engineer & DevOps

There are many robotics engineers, but few are Linux DevOps. I am **both**.

No better word describes my passion to building robots. I studied in a robotics master program and develop low- and high-level robot controllers. I now work as an engineer in a robotics startup.

Linux DevOps was a by-product from taking control of my digital life. It started with self-hosting [Pleroma](https://pleroma.social), a decentralized and open source social media platform. It led me to the FOSS communities and aspired me to be my own "cloud" provider, one software at a time. To this date, I manage half a dozen services with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) and virtual machines.

My hobby crossed path with my profession when I automated the development workflow for our robots with Ansible. Gone are the clumsy shell scripts, and comes the reproducible Ansible playbooks. [Grafana](https://grafana.com) also finds its way into our fleet management, besides my home dashboard.

I would not be happy without being the mind behind our robots or the superintendent of the robotic fleet.
