# Hello There

My name is Linghao Zhang. I am a Master Student at ETH ZÃ¼rich studying Robotics. My core competency is in Robotics control. I have worked with ANYmal and [ALMA](https://rsl.ethz.ch/robots-media/alma.html) in ETH's [Robotic Systems Lab](https://rsl.ethz.ch), with a focus on MPC an QP Controller. My main development language/framework is `C++` and `ROS`.

## Hobbies

As a self-taught and self-hosting Linux admin, I manage some Linux boxes and VMs, knowing my way around DevOps tools like `Ansible` and `nix`. This website is built with Hugo and `nix`.
